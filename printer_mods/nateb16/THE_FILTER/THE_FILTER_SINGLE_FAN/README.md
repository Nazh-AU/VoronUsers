Modification created by devsfan1830#3401 on the Voron Discord based on the CAD files for the standard spacing version.

Note, some details may not match whatever the current models are for the other variants. If you find an issue or an inconsistency, contact me via discord PM. No need to bug nate :) .

Print the same as the orginals. Note, you MUST print the left and right versions of each file. Mirroring any STL will result in misalignments. Orientation should be self-explanantory but its based on as if you were looking at your printer from the front.

The holes for the magnetic connector are based upon the aliexpress item linked in the main readme. I have notices there may be some variances in what you receive. If something doesnt fit right, again by all means PM  me on Discord.

Changelog:

12/24/2022: Initial version. Not yet tested but alignment and dimensions in CAD look good. Will update this when printed and tested (within 1-2 weeks).
