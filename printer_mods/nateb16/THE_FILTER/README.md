<h2>THE FILTER</h2>

![filter model](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40711977/205870094-7e7c07b6-8fc4-48cc-be1a-14624c461d2c.PNG)
<h2>ABOUT</h2>

THE FILTER is a custom mod of my own design. I was intially inspired to embark on this project after my Nevermore melted. It is a hybrid of Andrew ellis's bed fan's and the Nevermore in a completly custom housing. It features 3 5015 blower fans (only works with Fysetc bed hole spacing) and a large capacity for pellet charcoal in a two piece model with a bracket using a minimal amount of supplies. It is mounted from the front to DRASTICALLY improve heating of your printer chamber by blowing are over the bottom of the bed. I also wanted it to be easily removable so it features a optional magnetic quick disconnect using POGO connectors which is what I believe to be a first for a mod of this kind. This connector makes removal for PLA prints and maintenance easy. It is tested extensivly with over 40 hours of runtime and 50 connects and disconnects. Its high airflow and compact design makes it melt and warp resistant. Using 3d printed spacers it is also thermally isolated from the printer frame. 



<h2>Testing</h2>

Time the printer took to reach 40c
* Stock VORON 2.4 350mm - 55 minutes
* Nevermore VORON 2.4 350mm - 40 minutes
* THE FILTER VORON 2.4 350mm - 12 minutes

<h2>Parts Required</h2>

* (3) 5015 fans 
* (1) optional magnetic pogo power connector from digikey https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/adam-tech/PHR-C4777-02-FVP-800/9832016
* (1) optional power cord for pogo connector from digikey https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/adam-tech/CA-ST2-PHR-198-M/9832013 
* (1) jst-XH 2 pin connector with metal pin
* (1) 2 pin microfit molxex if not using the POGO connector
* (1) MISC heatshrink and solder (best) or Solder heatshrink tubing (better) or buttsplices (ok)

Installation:

1) Print the Models
2) Remove top covers of 5015 fans (Required)
3) Run Wires neatly and solder fans in parallel or use Solder heatshrink tubing
4) Remove bed from frame and mount Bracket to frame in the appropriate position (see pictures)
5) install spacers that prevent contact with aluminum extrusion

If Using Adam Tech connector's:
1) Print Soldering Jig (connector is magnetic and is very hard to solder with out being secured)
* center pin is positive 
* side pins are GND
2) Cut USB connector off it has two 24awg one red wire and one black 
3) Crimp on jst-XH and press the end of the connector into mounting bracket use super glue if the connector feels to loose
4) Connect to spider and adjust your config
